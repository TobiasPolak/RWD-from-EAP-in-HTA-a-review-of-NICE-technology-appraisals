During this time, we were unfortunately in a position to observe the effect of the withdrawal of treatment on our two children. After about 4 or 5 weeks

Much as we appreciate the developments in the Committee’s thinking, which have lead to these new preliminary recommendations and the introduction of the managed access agreement, we are extremely concerned that an extra two to three months has been added to this timescale. This additional delay extends this period of limbo, leaving us living with fear and uncertainty hanging over

I am concerned that the final decision has been delayed until January 2016 and urge the Committee to find ways in which this can be brought forward.

The committee concluded that, when starting                  treatment, those involved in the proposed managed access agreement                  must ensure that any patient receiving ataluren whose treatment is                  funded by NHS England under such an agreement is made aware of

The committee was                  advised by NICE that this made it sufficiently clear to people starting                  treatment with ataluren in the context of the proposed managed access                  agreement that the treatment period could be finite. 5.13          The committee then focused on whether the data collection from patients

The committee was largely               satisfied with the proposed patient outcomes and noted that the clinical

The Department of Health considered that this patient access               scheme does not constitute an excessive administrative burden on the               NHS. The proposed managed access agreement includes further               confidential financial components that would apply while it is in force. 4             Evidence submissions

The               committee noted that the patient numbers in the budget impact model that               accompanied the proposed managed access agreement were slightly               different to the original version, and that these had been deemed               confidential.

After taking other               cost implications such as patient access schemes and managed access               agreements into consideration where possible, the committee considered               that it had been presented with sufficient evidence to show that the cost of

It considered that the company’s analyses, in which               patients switched from ataluren to best supportive care after 5 years (that               is, when the proposed managed access agreement ended), were not               relevant to its decision-making and set them aside. This was because it               had heard from the clinical experts that, if recommended, ataluren would

The committee considered the overall value of ataluren,               taking into account both its health benefits measured in QALYs gained

In reaching its conclusion on value for money,               the committee considered the evidence of improved outcomes from

The committee was aware that juvenile-onset               hypophosphatasia had a variable overall clinical picture and that some

The               committee therefore considered that the proposed managed access               agreement did not sufficiently define the population with the greatest               clinical need. The committee concluded that the treatment need for

The committee               considered that the proposed methods lacked detail, and that no formal               analysis plan was submitted. The committee was aware that the company

The committee was aware that the company               proposed to combine the data collection for the managed access               agreement with the global hypophosphatasia registry that formed as part               of the company’s regulatory commitments. The committee expressed

The committee considered that the proposed data               collection was unlikely to gather sufficient evidence during the course of               the managed access agreement to adequately inform a review of the               guidance at the end of this period. The committee would have preferred               the company to have submitted a detailed protocol to more fully explore

It concluded that the               proposed data collection methods presented within the managed access               agreement had a number of important limitations.               Cost to the NHS and personal social services

Therefore the committee               concluded that NHS England and the company (Alexion Pharma UK)

It               concluded that the number of children who would receive treatment with               asfotase alfa within the proposed managed access agreement was               uncertain and may be higher than estimated by the company. In addition,               the committee considered the treatment rate for adults with juvenile-onset

It               recalled that it had considered the number of adults with paediatric-onset               hypophosphatasia to be uncertain and likely to rise, and the criteria in the

The committee concluded that               the number of adults with paediatric-onset hypophosphatasia treated with               asfotase alfa in the company’s analysis likely to be underestimated.

These estimates do not take into               account the number of people who would have asfotase alfa, the               proposed managed access agreement or any increases in diagnosis               rates.

The committee was concerned that the number of patients eligible for               treatment with asfotase alfa and the budget impact were likely to be

It was not convinced               that the criteria for starting, stopping and continuing treatment currently               proposed by the company in its managed access agreement would               appropriately identify those who had the greatest clinical need. Although               the committee had considered the evidence of improved outcomes from

The committee remained concerned at the very high               annual per-patient cost for asfotase alfa, which the proposed cost cap               would not substantially reduce during the period of the managed access               agreement because of the weight-based dosing of the therapy. 5.32          The committee discussed the value for money of asfotase alfa in children

The committee recalled               its assessment of the company’s proposed managed access agreement               (section 5.10) and the conclusion that it would be ineffective in identifying               the people who would most benefit from asfotase alfa treatment within this

Furthermore               the committee recalled that there was concern that the proposed start and               stop criteria in the managed access agreement were broad and not based               on objective criteria (see section 5.10). The committee noted that this               meant the number of people for whom treatment would be considered,

Although it retained some concerns that the starting and               stopping criteria may not be fully objective in some cases, the committee               recognised that the managed access agreement was developed with               experts to identify the population with greatest clinical need. 5.11          The committee discussed the proposed data collection methods

The committee considered that the proposed data               collection was unlikely to gather sufficient evidence during the course of               the managed access agreement to adequately inform a review of the               guidance at the end of this period. The committee would have preferred               the company to have submitted a detailed protocol to more fully explore

It               considered that this risk is not sufficiently shared by the company in the               proposed managed access agreement. 5.17          The committee considered the cost of asfotase alfa in the context of costs               incurred by the company for research, development and manufacturing.

Data from XXXX patients in the Named Patient Programme (recruited from 2014 after the data cut from AD1115611 LTFU) were not included in the company submission evidence synthesis.

Secondly, formal data analysis is planned after 3 years of follow up has been completed. However, some data from the Named Patient Programme was provided in Appendix 6 and the company also provided additional patient characteristics in response to a request for clarification made by the ERG (where applicable these data will be discussed below).

Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding recruitment of these 6 patients and whether patients at greater risk were excluded from these studies.

We are particularly concerned about the reference to the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib vs. BSC which seems to suggest a poorer survival outcome in the sunitinib arm, despite the data from the EAP which suggest a survival of 90 weeks in patients who have failed 400mg/day. This appears contrary to the evidence supporting sunitinib in the current NICE guidance and phase III RCT. Although the TAG have attempted to explain this result, it remains unclear and could be misleading.

Sanofi highlighted the perverse conclusions in the FAD described in                 their appeal submission. The EAP trial patients (from which the stable                 disease utility values were derived) had essentially the same                 characteristics as the TROPIC trial patients (from which the stable

EAP was an open label study with a relatively small number of UK

However patients whose disease has progressed, but who     are fit enough to have treatment, in any case form a small group.     Patients in the EAP study were typical of those that would be eligible     for this drug if funded. Many were taking opiates, all had metastatic     disease, and some had other symptoms such as lymphoedema.

The Appraisal Committee Chair stated that there were 15 exclusions to     the EAP study (in the manufacturer’s submission) and so it could not     be claimed that it was an unselected group of men with mHRPC. It     was the open label aspect of the EAP trial that was at issue, not the

When the data from EAP study was subsequently presented     in a conference Abstract, it appeared that most of these “drop outs”     were in fact patients whose disease had progressed.

The Appeal Panel concluded that the Appraisal Committee did                 understand the EAP trial. The Panel felt it was understandable that                 the utility values presented seemed high when compared with the age                 matched population, and that this could be seen to lack face validity.

Sanofi stated that the EAP trial was the only study to collect utility                 values for patient with mHRPC and thus its utility value had to be used                 in the modelling. The trial patients represented men who would be

Their literature review had                 found a small number of papers which had also found utility values                 (0.7-0.8) similar to those observed in the EAP study. This was similar                 to the male general population because to be eligible for EAP/TROPIC                 men had to have good functional status (ECOG 0-1). Sanofi objected

The extent to which patients’ experiences of their disease and their treatment were captured by the EQ-5D data, and the appropriate interpretation of this information in light of the knowledge of the

In our response to the ACD, updated utility data were provided from a second interim analysis of the EAP trial. This increased the information available to the Committee and lent further weight to the results of the first interim analysis, replicating the trends seen and increasing the patient numbers. We also provided several sources of evidence that

The EAP only considers patients treated with cabazitaxel however, the clinical advisors to  the ERG for TA255 had no reason to believe that the utility for patients would be affected by  the type of second-line chemotherapy used (i.e. cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone).

In  fact the UK EAP has shown that HRQL in the stable state may increase with time on therapy  and although not a statistically significant trend this is an observation supported by clinical  opinion (see Appendix 17).

(Section  5.2.2). As discussed in Section 5.4.8 above, in the base-case for the cost-effectiveness  analysis, baseline utility is taken from the UK EAP for the stable disease state (See section  5.4.1 above) and successive on treatment cycles are assumed to follow the values for each  cycle observed in the UK EAP.

As in the PACE study, no differences in response rates were observed between patients with or without mutations in the Spanish Compassionate Use Program. Regarding the safety of treatment, ponatinib use in the real-world appears to be associated with manageable AEs.27 The most common non-haematologic AEs were liver toxicity

For example, the AG calculated the duration of treatment in all 52 patients in the compassionate use program to be * months, Eisai reported this to be 6.56 months in the 18 patients who had completed treatment to be between 5 and 6 months in the Swiss and French audits, respectively.

Unfortunately, no efficacy results are available for patients in the compassionate use program in England, all of whom had received a previous TKI. Therefore, the SELECT trial is the only trial from which it is possible to estimate relative effectiveness since this is the only study with

The lack of any efficacy data from the compassionate use program is particularly disappointing, if understandable given the length of this program to date. If available, OS findings from the SELECT trial by subgroup may be more informative with regard to evidence for clinical effectiveness. However,

Although the committee recognised that a managed access               arrangement could reduce the risk to the NHS, the ICER for nusinersen               would need to plausibly be within a range that could be considered cost

The committee noted that the risk to the               NHS could be reduced through a managed access arrangement, but that               such an agreement would have to carry the support of NHS England,               patients, carers and clinicians, and that nusinersen would need to have

Collecting further data and gaining a deeper understanding of the impact of                        SMA on patients and carers is required to improve these estimates.

During this time, the condition of patients who                could benefit from the treatment will have irrevocably altered and it is only because of the                Expanded Access Programme that we have not seen many children dying during this                period.

We do therefore not support these recommendations.             We also note that despite the advanced disease stage at the point of recruitment, the fatality in the             SMA1 population recruited under the EAP commenced in the UK in August 2017 has dramatically             decreased. We have indicated above that motor function improved in the majority of these patients             despite the already advanced stage of disease at the time nusinersen treatment was commenced.

The company have not provided evidence to demonstrate that entrectinib has plausible potential for cost-effectiveness. The uncertainty around entrectinib’s plausible                                           potential to be cost-effective largely rests on the testing costs that will be incurred if entrectinib is recommended in the Cancer Drugs Fund in a period of managed access.  Technical team preliminary               The technical team considers that entrectinib meets the criteria for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund. However, taking into account its considerations about the end of life  judgement and rationale                  criteria, the technical team is currently uncertain about entrectinib’s plausible potential to be cost-effective at the offered price given the current uncertainty around testing

It is discussed below in terms of the pathway and how it may affect patient flow in the future.              Our base case population was fourth line (4L) patients who have received 3 prior lines of therapy. This is where clinicians have told us the              current unmet need is. The rapid uptake of patients into the Early Access Medicines Scheme (EAMS) at 4L (academic / commercial in              confidence information removed in 5 months), reinforces the high unmet at 4L need despite the recent availability of daratumumab via the              CDF at 2L. Recent market research by IQVIA show that lenalidomide-based regimens are still the predominant treatments at 3L (March/April
