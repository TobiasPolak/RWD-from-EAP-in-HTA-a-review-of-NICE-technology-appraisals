Recent evidence from the UK EAP study suggests that cabazitaxel can be used safely in UK practice with manageable toxicity. As noted by Bahl et al.50 (the authors of the UK EAP study) lower rates of neutropenia and sepsis were observed in the UK EAP cohort where primary prophylactic G-CSF use was common, whereas this was not permitted during the first cycle in the original TROPIC study11 but was allowed (at physicians discretion) after first occurrence of either"

This is only going to get worse with the                                  imminent closure of the EAP for Type 1 on 1st November. If not resolved before then we will see infants with SMA Type 1                                  missing the critical early treatment window which gives the best opportunity for positive outcomes and the very real prospect of                                  these infants dying."

The technical team                                           considers the screening pathway to depend on the provisions set up by NHS England in a timeframe that aligns with the NTRK appraisals.

The uncertainty around entrectinib’s plausible                                           potential to be cost-effective largely rests on the testing costs that will be incurred if entrectinib is recommended in the Cancer Drugs Fund in a period of managed access.
